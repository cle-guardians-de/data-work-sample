## DATA-WORK-SAMPLE INSTRUCTIONS

Below are descriptions of the 3 files that represent what will be your work sample for a small skills assessment on backend data engineering.  To complete challenge follow these steps:

**Step 1:** Open de-work-sample.ipynb in google colab.  To do so please **[click here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/cle-guardians-de/data-work-sample/blob/main/de_work_sample.ipynb)**.

**Step 2:** Run first code cell which will download files needed for assessment.

**Step 3:** In notebook complete the 3 questions by entering code within the 3 cells below each question.  Be sure to print answers to output.

**Step 4:** Save a copy of the updated de-work-samply.ipynb to google drive and create a shared link (top right corner in colab notebook "Share" link).  This link should be accessible to anyone with it.  Finally, paste that link into the original form of the email you got for this coding challenge and submit.

## File Descriptions

**bball-sqlite.db (unzipped from bball-sqlite.zip)** Question #1 data to query against

**example_play.json** Questions #2-3 data to import and query from sqlite database

**de-work-sample.ipynb** Jupyter notebook where code should go to answer questions... goal is to be able to run notebook and produce answers.  The notebook should be idempotent - meaning no matter how many times its ran it produces same result
