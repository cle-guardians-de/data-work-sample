Result set should be player, season, era, previous era, difference between previous year era, earned runs, and outs.  Any value that's represented as era should be in 3 decimal point precision.Pitching er=earned runs https://www.mlb.com/glossary/standard-stats/earned-run-average, outs are outs in inning https://www.mlb.com/glossary/standard-stats/innings-pitched"

These files consist of nested json and we'd like to consume the data to begin getting this feed incorporated into our warehouse.  First step you've been tasked with is getting the positional data into sql rows/columns.  So, create a table called MergedPositionalData that consists of.. playId, timestamp, id, typ, x, y, z.  The json file is called example_play.json (downloaded in first code cell).  And the positional data is nested under mergedPositionalData key.  playId is under Play.  For context... this data is the x,y,z coordinate on the field of play for players, umpires, and the ball every .033 seconds.\n"
